# MongoDB-Project


## Overview
This project demonstrates my practical experience and learning with **MongoDB**, including both local and cloud-based databases. I have explored MongoDB Compass, Atlas, and VS Code integrations to manage and manipulate data.

## Skills and Features Implemented

- **Database Creation**
  - Created databases and collections using MongoDB and Atlas.
  - Learned document-based data modeling.

- **CRUD Operations**
  - **Create:** Inserted single and multiple documents.
  - **Read:** Queried documents using filters and projections.
  - **Update:** Updated existing documents using various operators.
  - **Delete:** Removed documents and collections as needed.

- **Advanced Queries**
  - Used **comparison operators** (`$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt`, etc.).
  - Applied **logical operators** (`$and`, `$or`, `$not`) for complex queries.
  - Performed **aggregation pipelines** to summarize and analyze data.

- **Tools and Platforms**
  - **MongoDB Compass:** Visual exploration and manipulation of MongoDB data.
  - **VS Code:** Connected to MongoDB for coding and testing queries.
  - **MongoDB Atlas:** Created and managed cloud databases.

- **Additional Concepts**
  - Creating collections and databases programmatically.
  - Understanding MongoDB document structure.
  - Integration of MongoDB with Python or other development environments.
